% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\section{Experience}
\runsubsection{Nanome Inc.}
\descript{Data Scientist}
\location{Jan 2020 - Present | San Diego, CA}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item \emph{Developed} a novel deep-learning based approach to address the company's voice recognition needs.
\item \emph{Pioneered} an alpha build for the company platform's $1^{st}$ attempt at a voice command assistant for the platform.
\item \emph{Reduced} server latency for voice responses by 75\% compared to on-device recognition for Oculus devices.
\item \emph{Improved} command hit rate by 12\% using an implementation of \textbf{LSTM-based DeepSpeech} and \textbf{BERT embeddings}.
\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Metrim Data}
\descript{Data Scientist / Co-Founder}
\location{Nov 2017 – Oct 2019 | San Diego, CA}
\begin{tightemize}
\item \emph{Devised} a novel method using \textbf{Recurrent Neural Networks} and \textbf{Variational Autoencoders} for target prediction.
\item \emph{Optimized} our inference models to run on \textbf{Google Cloud TPUs} instead of multiple GPUs
\item \emph{Observed} a 4x improvement in inference times and a 3x speed up in training times as a result of the aforementioned optimizations.
\item {Engineered} an end-to-end data ingestion and \textbf{ETL pipeline} to
    run on 10 TB of data from the Common Crawl dataset.
\item Extracted features for led prediction were stored in a MySQL database to be queried with a \textbf{REST API} by our front-end.

\descript{Instructional Assistant}
\location{Jan 2018 - Present | San Diego, CA}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item \emph{Automated} style checks for DSC 20 which directly resulted in over
    500+ tutor hours saved in the last 2 years as well as saving the Data
    Science department over \textbf{USD \$10,000} in tutor compensation.
\item \emph{Implemented} a linear regression based runtime check in DSC 40B which has so far resulted in 20+ hours of manual grading saved for the tutors along with direct cost savings for the department.
\item \emph{Created} several homework and exam solutions to administer the coursework effectively and uphold the value of a UCSD degree.
