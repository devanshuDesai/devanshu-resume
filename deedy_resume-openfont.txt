Nov 2017 – Oct 2019 | San Diego, CA
• Devised a novel method using Recurrent Neural Networks and Variational
Autoencoders for target prediction.
• Optimized our inference models to run on Google Cloud TPUs instead of
multiple GPUs
• Observed a in 4x speed in inference times and a 3x speed up in training times as
a result of the aforementioned optimizations.
• Developed an end-to-end data ingestion and ETL pipeline to run on 10
terabytes of data from the Common Crawl dataset.
• Extracted features for lead prediction were stored in a MySQL database to be
queried with a REST API by our front-end.

UC SAN DIEGO Instructional Assistant
Jan 2018 - Present | San Diego, CA
• Automated style checks for DSC 20 which directly resulted in over 500+ tutor
hours saved in the last 2 years as well as saving the Data Science department
over USD $10,000 in tutor salaries.
• Implemented a linear regression based runtime check in DSC 40B which has so
far resulted in 20+ hours of manual grading saved for the tutors along with
direct cost savings for the department.
• Created several homework and exam solutions to administer the coursework
effectively and uphold the value of a UCSD degree.
