PUBLICATIONS
Dive Into Data Science

METRIM DATA Data Scientist
Nov 2017 – Oct 2019 | San Diego, CA
• Devised a novel method using Recurrent Neural Networks and Variational
Autoencoders for target prediction.
• Optimized our inference models to run on Google Cloud TPUs instead of
multiple GPUs
• Observed a 4x improvement in inference times and a 3x speedup in training
times as a result of the aforementioned optimizations.
• Engineered end-to-end data ingestion and ETL pipeline to run on 10 TB of data
from the Common Crawl dataset.
• Extracted features for lead prediction were stored in a MySQL database to be
queried with a REST API by our front-end.

UC SAN DIEGO Instructional Assistant
Jan 2019 - Present | San Diego, CA
• Automated style checks for DSC 20 which directly resulted in over 500+ tutor
hours saved in the last 2 years as well as saving the Data Science department
over USD $10,000 in tutor compensation.
• Implemented a linear regression-based runtime check-in DSC 40B which has so
far resulted in 20+ hours of manual grading saved for the tutors along with
direct cost savings for the department.
• Created several homework and exam solutions to administer the coursework
effectively and uphold the value of a UCSD degree.

RESEARCH
MCAULEY LAB Undergraduate Research Scholar
Dec 2020 – Present | San Diego, CA
• Optimized Recommender Systems to using Facebook AI Research’s state of the
art benchmarking platform.
• Mentored under Julian McAuley.

SU LAB | Research Assistant
Jan 2020 – April 2020 | San Diego, CA
• Collaborated with post-doctoral researchers in Hao Su.
• Customized Facebook AI Research’s VoteNet model to work on a custom
dataset.
• Augmented the PartNet dataset to perform better with our model resulting in a
1.5% improvement in classification accuracy.
